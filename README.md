# midigamepad

"Midigamepad" is a VB6 application based on the work of Daniel Aue's "Midi-TÃ¶ne", which utilizes the work of K. Kangbein, David Churcher, Zane Thomas, and Mabry Software. This software demonstrates how MIDI can be used as a gaming controller for playing games like World of Warcraft.

I created this software to be compatible with my AKAI MPK MINI 3, but it should also work with other controllers. If you need to configure it, simply edit the text boxes with the second byte and the "real" keyboard key that you want to activate. If the program doesn't work, please ensure that you have the MSVB6 runtimes installed or in the same folder as Midigamepad.
