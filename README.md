# midigamepad

midigamepad is a vb6 app based on the work of 'Midi-TÃ¶ne' by Daniel Aue, who also used the work of K. Kangbein, David Churcher, Zane Thomas and Mabry Software. Thanks to them! This is a very simple example of the application of MIDI (a music pad) as a gaming controller to play (specially) World of Warcraft.

I've created this software to be compatible with my AKAI MPK MINI 3, but it should works with other controllers. If you want to configure it at your own, just edit the textboxes with the second byte + the "real" key of the keyboard that you want to activate then. If program doesn't work, please be sure that you got MSVB6 runtimes installed or in the same folder of midigamepad.
